      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hey Guys! I’m sure you’re wondering why I sent you this URL. Brace yourself for this…I am learning how to code! That’s right, your girl Tina is leaving the classroom and headed to the internet to create content for the world to see.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>As most of you know, I spent most of my childhood in Hawaii. My family relocated to Augusta, Georgia where I eventually graduated from “The Best Little High School in Richmond County”, A. R. Johnson Magnet School. Carrollton and Decatur served as temporary homes while earning my bachelor’s and master’s degrees. Today, my husband and I call Conyers home. It’s the perfect mix of city and country if you ask me.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Now that life has slowed down during this Great Pause, as I like to call it, I have more free time than ever before. To fill the time, I enjoy journaling and spending quiet time with the Creator. Climbing Stone Mountain and running around the neighborhood with my husband has been lots of fun! One day, I would like to learn how to paint watercolors and draw calligraphy.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Any place of employment can be become my dream job if it has the following core ideals: Everyone’s input is considered valuable | Cultivating a learning culture is paramount | Collaboration is key to the success of the project | When necessary, working remotely is a viable option | Most importantly, the work done is produced with excellence, meeting client expectations, with the sole intent of contributing positive product to bridge socioeconomic gaps.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Conyers. It is a small town in Georgia about 30 miles east of downtown Atlanta.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>After working as an educator for 8 and a half years in low socioeconomic and urban communities, I have a newfound respect for the classroom teacher. Along with curriculum, they teach responsibility, resilience, empathy, productivity and much more.  I have seen many qualified, passionate educators lose steam due to the demands of their work.  As a web developer, I endeavor to make teaching and learning easier for teachers. Especially within this season of ‘home school learning’, its important that educators have access to distance learning tools that will continue to make their work meaningful.
